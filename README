signature_block.vim is a simple plugin for adding and manipulating signature blocks in e-mails.

It provides handy functions that can be called from maps or autocommands.

There are other scripts offering similar functionality, see vimscript #45 or vimscript #10 or vimscript #509 but signature_block.vim is easier to understand and it can be easily extended.
